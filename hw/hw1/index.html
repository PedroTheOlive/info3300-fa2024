    Javascript type (i.e., officially documented as a type) or it is not a canonical type. You
    are welcome to use JS documentation such as the mdn web doc for reference.</p>

    <em>Problem 2:</em>
    <p>
      Null is a canonical Javascript type, but it has some unusual or unexpected typeof() behavior. 
      In 1-2 sentences, explain the unusual behavior that it has.
      <br><br>
      In Javascript, running typeof( null ) in the console returns the type of null being an object 
      rather than as undefined like in other languages.
      <script >
        console.log( "typeof( null ) = " + typeof(null) );
      </script>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="p3">
    <em>Problem 3:</em>
    <p>
      First, in 1-2 sentences, please define type coercion. Then, in your p tag please provide
      two examples where type coercion produces an answer that is unusual or unexpected (i.e.,
      different from Python output or a case where Python would throw an exception). For each
      sample, briefly explain why it is unexpected. Then, in the script section put both of your
      code examples into a console.log() statement so we can see the result (e.g.,
      console.log("apple" + "orange") )
      <br><br>
      Type coercion is when there is an operation unsupported between two different types and so one 
      type is changed in order to do that operation. For instance, adding 3 to the boolean true would 
      usually lead to a type error but javascript will take true to be the int 1 and return 4. Another 
      instance is in adding the int 10 to the string "10". The string takes precedence and so the int 
      is changed into a string and the operation returns "1010".
      <script>
        console.log( "Adding 3 and true..." );
        console.log( 3 + true );
        console.log( "Adding 10 and \"10\"..." );
        console.log( 10 + "10" );
      </script>
    </p>

    <em>Problem 4:</em>
    <p>
      Describe, in your own words, the course policy on late and unreadable work outlined in
      the syllabus, which is linked from the course website. 
      <br><br>
      Any and all late work will receive a 0. Furthermore, files that can't be decompressed, missing key 
      files, or incorrect files will also receive a 0. It's recommended to redownload submitted assignments 
      to verify. Becuase this policy is harsher, students also receive 5 slip days for homeworks with up to 
      three being able to be used per hw assignment. The two lowest homework grades will also be dropped.
