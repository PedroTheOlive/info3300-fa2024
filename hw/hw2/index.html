    <h4>Homework 2</h4>

    <div id="p1">
        <em>Problem 1:</em>
        <p> In a <em>script</em> tag for this problem, create a recursive function, fact( n ), which takes an
            integer, n, as an argument and returns the factorial of n. Do not use loops or the built-in
            factorial functions to accomplish this. Remember that recursion involves two major
            components: base case(s) and recursive calls of the same function.
            <br><br>
            Make sure that your fact function handles negative integers by returning undefined,
            properly returns 1 for fact( 0 ), and otherwise uses recursion to compute correct factorials
            for larger integers.
            <br><br>
            Include the following code block after your function to prove it works as expected:<br>
            console.log( fact(-2) );<br>
            console.log( fact(0) );<br>
            console.log( fact(1) );<br>
            console.log( fact(5) );<br>
            console.log( fact(12) );<br><br>
            (As the function is only intended to handle integers, do not worry about implementing the
            gamma function for decimal numbers)

            <script>
                function fact( n ){
                    if( n < 0 ){
                        return undefined;
                    }
                    else if( n == 0){
                        return 1;
                    } else {
                        return n * fact( n - 1 );
                    }
                }

                console.log( "fact(-2) = " + fact( -2 ) );
                console.log( "fact(0) = " + fact( 0 ) );
                console.log( "fact(1) = " + fact( 1 ) );
                console.log( "fact(5) = " + fact( 5 ) );
                console.log( "fact(12) = " + fact( 12 ) );

        <em>Problem 2:</em>
        <p>  
            In class, we learned that <em>path</em> elements can be very useful (see docs <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths">here</a>). In the <em>p</em>
            tag for this problem, please write a sentence for each of the following commands that
            describes what it does when it is included in the d attribute of a <em>path</em> element (for example,
            A tells the path to draw an arc on the canvas):
            <br><br>

            <ol class="llist">
                <li>M: This command moves the brush over to the specified pixel coordinates (without drawing a line)</li>
                <li>L: This command moves the brush over to the specified pixel coordinates (while also drawing a line connecting the two points)</li>
                <li>V: This command moves the bursh in a vertical line a specified number of pixels (while drawing a line)</li>
                <li>H: This command moves the bursh in a horizontal line a specified number of pixels (while drawing a line)</li>
                <li>Z: This command loses the path and draws a line from the current position back to the origin</li>

        <em>Problem 3:</em>
        <p>  
            Since we want you to get more experience working with SVG, we would like you to
            complete the final problem in this assignment using handwritten SVG elements. You are
            not permitted to use Javascript for this problem. You can use a 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool">color picker tool</a> 
            to find good colors, but once again they must appear as literal elements in the file. You may not 
            use an SVG authoring tool like Adobe Illustrator. We can tell if you use one, and the time it would
            take to obfuscate their output is much greater than just doing the assignment.
            <br><br>
            Create a 400x400 <em>svg</em> canvas element in the <em>p</em> tag for this problem.
            Use <em>line</em> and <em>rect</em> elements to create your own version of a Piet Mondrian painting in
            your canvas. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/piet-mondrian">Piet Mondrian</a>
            was an early 20th century artist who, as a member of the De Stijl
            movement, reduced his art to three primary colors and black lines in a series of famous
            neoplasticist works. Here are some examples: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80160">one</a>, 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/3014">two</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/3013">three</a>. 
            As art often thrives in the presence of constraints, here are some rules to follow for your own work:
            <br><br>
            • You must include at least 6 lines and 3 rectangles.<br>
            • <em>line</em> elements must use a black stroke and <em>rect</em> elements must be either white,
            red, yellow, or blue fill (they do not need to be #F00, #0F0, and #00F, just
            recognizable shades of those colors).<br>
            • <em>rect</em> elements cannot have a stroke – only use a fill for them.<br>
            • If you want black borders, you must use <em>line</em> elements to create them.<br>
            • You may include additional features you feel would add aesthetic value, such as a
            frame around the canvas, but you must include required elements to receive credit.<br><br><br>
